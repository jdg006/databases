3. the order that they are in, in your select statement determines the order that they will be displayed in
for example SELECT date, amount,  donor will display the results for the date first the amount second and the donor
third despite the original table being ordered donor, amount, date.

4. You can use offset to disqualify a certain group of people. If you have a table of individuals who ran a race and how they placed
and the best two runners were determined to have used PEDs you can offset a descending order query by two to find
the best runners who did not cheat.

5. Order by will give your results in order which will make finding data easier. You know that if you have an 
ascending ordered table and want to find the highest number you would know to look at the end or if you wanted to
find the lowest number you would know to look at the beggining of the table.

6. WHERE works before items are grouped in a table and having works after items have been grouped.

7. SELECT id, amount
   FROM payment
   WHERE amount > 200;
   
8. SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY intake_date;
   SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY date desc LIMIT 5;
   SELECT * FROM cats WHERE gender = 'F' AND age >= 2;
   SELECT SUM(amount) AS total, donor FROM donations GROUP BY donor ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 5; 
   SELECT SUM(amount) AS total, donor FROM donations GROUP BY donor ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 9 OFFSET 5;
